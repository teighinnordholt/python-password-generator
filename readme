This .py will prompt you on the length you would like your password and will create a random one that long. The "Choices.txt" file is necessary as it contains all the characters to be chosen from when creating a password and can be edited yourself, but each option must be put on a new line. The "password.txt" is only a temperary place to hold the generated password and does not have to be downloaded: the program will create its own on run.
